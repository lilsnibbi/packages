 * styling library. Every part of a line is themeable by token, the layout and
 * the rendering of individual values can be replaced with hooks, and output
 * can be mirrored to a rotating log file.
 *
 * Every emitting method takes a trailing {@link LogCallOptions} bag that
 * overrides the configuration for that one record — the corners of a box, the
 * layout, the theme, the name — so per-request detail costs a second argument
 * rather than a logger per request. Passing `true` in its place, or
 * `raw: true` inside it, returns the formatted string instead of printing it,
 * writing nothing to the file and calling no `transport`.
 *

 * ```ts
 * const logger = new Logger({
 *   name: "api",
 *   level: "NOTIF",
 *   theme: { NOTIF: { color: "#7aa2f7" } },
 *   file: { directory: "logs", filename: "api", maxFiles: 7 },
 * });
 *
 * logger.notif("listening on :3000");
 * logger.error(new Error("query timed out"));
 *
 * logger.notif("cache miss", {
